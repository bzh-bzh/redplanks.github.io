To that end, they built the largest two battleships in history: the mighty <i>Yamato</i> and her sister ship <i>Musashi</i>. Designed so that “to match [them], the Americans would have to build battleships that were too wide to fit through the Panama Canal”, they were meant to be used to knock out the entire US Pacific Fleet in a single decisive battle. This was called the “Kantai Kessen” by the IJN. Ideally, the attacking US fleet would be chipped away by Japanese attack submarines, before the Japanese Combined Fleet engaged them far away from USN supply bases. The attack on Pearl Harbor was a natural extension of this doctrine, intended to wipe out the battleships and aircraft carriers of the US Navy in a single decisive blow. <a id="link4-1" href="javascript:;">[4]</a></p><p>From this strategy, we can see that Japanese military leaders were focused on a swift offensive war, that would quickly force America into a prolonged war of attrition that they believed would pressure the American people into accepting a negotiated surrender, leaving Japan with most of its conquered territories. Only a small minority, such as Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, privately held doubts that America would surrender so easily. This misguided view of Americans as soft and easily frightened came from long-standing racism between the Japanese and Americans. Conversely, Americans viewed the Japanese as “yellow devils”, incapable of military feats such as the attack on Pearl Harbor. <a id="link4-2" href="javascript:;">[4]</a> The Japanese military, made a fatal mistake in aiming for a knockout blow on the US that would force them to surrender by public opinion. As the war went on and America refused to surrender, the IJN found itself at a severe disadvantage in ships, planes, and trained men.</p><paper-tooltip for="link4-1" animationdelay="0" fittovisiblebounds="true" position="top">4.

This stemmed from the Japanese belief in a Decisive Battle--they wanted to crush the opposition in any such battle. Within each fleet, launching air groups was extremely coordinated, with whole squadrons launched in just minutes. <a id="link6-1" href="javascript:;">[6]</a></p><p>In contrast, the US Navy would place its carriers in temporary fleets called Task Forces. In the beginning of the war, when there were only a few American carriers operating in the Pacific, carriers would be split into different Task Forces to conduct harassment raids. As carriers sailed out of US shipyards later in the war, carriers were eventually consolidated into a few Task Forces. While this tactical grouping led to operational flexibility, it left much to be desired in coordination. Because the US Navy conceived as aircraft carriers are independent units, each carrier would have its own commander in charge of launching and retrieving plane squadrons. This produced staggered waves of attack planes launching at different times, not a single coordinated strike. <a id="link6-2" href="javascript:;">[6]</a></p><paper-tooltip for="link6-1" animationdelay="0" fittovisiblebounds="true" position="top">6.

As Japanese rearmament progressed, the entire war effort came to rest on the keels of its fleet of merchant ships. At the start of the war, the combined merchant fleet transported a total of 6.2 million tons, and imported everything from steel to sugar. <a id="link7-1" href="javascript:;">[7]</a> These ships were the lifeblood of the Japanese Empire in the same way the railroads linked together America, transporting goods, men, and war materiel across a continent.</p><paper-tooltip for="link7-1" animationdelay="0" fittovisiblebounds="true" position="top">7.

While traditionally quick and cheap destroyer-class ships were used for anti-submarine warfare(ASW) escort duty, Japan envisioned its destroyers as offensive torpedo boats. In addition, they conceptualized the submarine in an offensive role against US warships, and failed to consider the possibility that the US would undertake a large-scale anti-shipping campaign. <a id="link4-3" href="javascript:;">[4]</a> The US, being forced into the defensive early, also enjoyed the logistical advantage of having shorter shipping routes than the Japanese, who had to manage and defend the entirety of their conquered Southeast Asian territories. By the time Japan started building ASW escorts in earnest, their merchant fleet was already in tatters. In fact, by the end of the war, American submarine skippers complained of having to compete with other skippers for the prize of Japanese merchant ships <a id="link7-2" href="javascript:;">[7]</a>. The sinking of millions of tons of Japanese cargo slowly strangled the Japanese wartime economy, necessitating massive rationing and the lowering of Japanese living standards to almost poverty. In contrast, America emerged from the Great Depression into a period of unprecedented prosperity.</p><paper-tooltip for="link4-3" animationdelay="0" fittovisiblebounds="true" position="top">4.

Before Midway, America was on the defensive, outnumbered by the carriers of Japan. After Midway, four of the IJN’s biggest and most technologically advanced carriers were sunk. The <i>Akagi</i>, <i>Kaga</i>, <i>Hiryu</i>, and <i>Soryu</i> were left at the bottom of the sea, and with them lay Japan’s offensive strategy. Its only chance of suing for peace with the US was gone, leaving it trapped in a war of attrition it was destined to lose.</p></paper-material><paper-material elevation="2"><h2>Background</h2><p>An attack on Midway was pushed by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto to finish what Pearl Harbor had started--the complete and utter destruction of the US Pacific Fleet, in order to force America into negotiations with Japan. He hoped to draw American carriers into a fatal engagement by attacking Midway with carrier-based bombers. However, having broken the Japanese naval code, the US Navy was forewarned of the threat, and was in position to place its entire available carrier force near Midway. At the eve of battle, the carriers <i>Akagi</i>, <i>Kaga</i>, <i>Hiryu</i>, and <i>Soryu</i> faced off against the <i>Yorktown</i>, <i>Enterprise</i>, and <i>Hornet</i>. <a id="link6-3" href="javascript:;">[6]</a></p><paper-tooltip for="link6-3" animationdelay="0" fittovisiblebounds="true" position="top">6. The Battle of Midway.</paper-tooltip></paper-material><paper-material elevation="2"><h2>Breaking the Japanese Naval Code</h2><p>The naval intelligence that allowed the US Navy to ambush the Japanese Navy at Midway was the product of one man--Captain Joseph Rochefort. Within his position in the American radio interception and decryption station, named HYPO, Rochefort received reports that Japan was planning a large attack on a target codenamed “AF”. While Rochefort suspected that AF was Midway Island, he needed a way to prove this to his superiors. In a now-famous plan, he cabled Midway and told them to send an unencrypted radio message stating that the water distillation plant at Midway had broken down. Duly, the Japanese reported in a coded message that AF’s water plant had broken down. <a id="link6-4" href="javascript:;">[6]</a> Despite the fact that the US victory at Midway would not have been possible without Rochefort’s intelligence, he was only awarded the Medal of Honor in 1985, posthumously.</p><paper-tooltip for="link6-4" animationdelay="0" fittovisiblebounds="true" position="top">6.

Land-based aircraft from Midway attacked the fleet, with no success and many losses. While Nagumo ordered a refit of all his remaining bombers to fragmentation and high-explosive bombs to attack Midway Island a second time, a scout plane spotted the American carrier fleet. Nagumo ordered a second refit back to anti-ship armor-piercing bombs. This tied up valuable time, preventing the Japanese from launching an attack on the American carriers in time to stop the American attack on the Japanese force. It also left bombs and fuel tanks exposed on top of the flight deck of the carriers. <a id="link8-1" href="javascript:;">[8]</a> Shortly after, a torpedo bomber squadron from the <i>Hornet</i> attacked the Japanese fleet unescorted and was summarily slaughtered, with no torpedo hits scored. However, the loss of the torpedo squadron kept the Zeroes which were defending the fleet at a low altitude. Critically, this left them unable to intercept the dive bomber squadrons from the <i>Enterprise</i> and <i>Yorktown</i>, which came over the Japanese carrier fleet at the same time by sheer coincidence. The dive bombers struck the <i>Akagi</i>, <i>Kaga</i>, and <i>Soryu</i> within the span of a few minutes; bomb hits ignited the fuel and ammunition lying on the deck, causing massive infernos that forced the carriers to be abandoned and sunk. Planes launched from the only surviving Japanese carrier, <i>Hiryu</i>, scored torpedo hits on the <i>Yorktown</i>, crippling her. That afternoon, the <i>Hiryu</i> was spotted, and dive bombers launched by the <i>Enterprise</i> sunk her. A few days later, while the <i>Yorktown</i> was being repaired, a Japanese submarine, <i>I-168</i>, torpedoed the Yorktown, sinking her.</p><paper-tooltip for="link8-1" animationdelay="0" fittovisiblebounds="true" position="top">8.

In addition, many highly trained Japanese pilots were killed during Midway, leading to a lack of trained pilots later in the war. While the USN lost the <i>Yorktown</i>, in a display of American production might, the <i>Yorktown</i> was reincarnated one year later as an Essex-class carrier. While the Battle of Midway was a decisive battle, it was decisive not to Japan’s victory, but to America’s.</p></paper-material><p class="vertical-space">Created with <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org">Polymer by Google.</a></p></neon-animatable><neon-animatable><paper-material elevation="2"><h2>The Iron Law of Economics</h2><p>Midway knocked out the majority of Japan’s carrier fleet, and the Japanese were unable to recover fully from that blow. Japan had only achieved an initial naval advantage by secretly violating international treaties, and they did not have the resources to replace significant ship losses. In 1941, when the US entered the war, Japan produced 49 ships to the US’s 41. However, next year, the US overtook Japan with 86 ships built to 68. The US also built a total of 203 submarines to Japan’s 167, allowing the US to sink much of Japan’s merchant shipping <a id="link9-1" href="javascript:;">[9]</a>. Japan’s remaining surface fleet also suffered from critical oil shortages resulting from the loss of tankers, forcing many ships to use inferior quality fuel, and preventing other ships from leaving port at all.</p><paper-tooltip for="link9-1" animationdelay="0" fittovisiblebounds="true" position="top">9.

They used the highly successful strategy of “island-hopping”. Well-defended Japanese garrisons would simply have their supply routes cut off, starving the defenders out. However, when an island needed to be taken for strategic purposes, the fighting was long and bloody. The Japanese Army entrenched themselves deep into islands, constructing well-built defenses that took weeks to overwhelm. The most well-known example is the battle of Iwo Jima, which lasted for five weeks, and had a US casualty rate of almost one third. These bloody battles played one factor in the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan, rather than invading it conventionally.</p></paper-material><paper-material elevation="2"><iron-image src="../images/iwo-jima.jpg" preload="" fade="" sizing="contain" style="width:100%;height:500px;"></iron-image><div class="caption">The famous, Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of two Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima. <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/520748">[16]</a></div></paper-material><paper-material elevation="2"><h2>Strategic Bombing, and The Last Bomb</h2><p>The use of bombers in World War II was divided into two schools of thought--tactical and strategic bombing. Tactical bombing advocated the precision bombing of military targets such as factories, bases, and supply depots. In contrast, strategic bombing blanketed major cities with bombs, targeting civilians and soldiers indiscriminately. The aim of strategic bombing was to break the morale of an entire country, and to destroy the industrial production within that city. While tactical bombing was clearly the most humane and least resource-intensive option, the technology available to WWII combatants was not adequately equipped to strike small targets from high altitudes. Because of this limitation, the Allies undertook massive strategic bombing campaigns in the later years of the war, in both Europe and Asia <a id="link9-2" href="javascript:;">[9]</a>.</p><p>The justification for bombing the major cities of Japan was given to be that Allied war planners had determined that Japanese industry remained relatively spread out throughout major cities, making area bombing necessary. One of the most devastating raids of the Japan strategic bombing campaign was the use of firebombs against Tokyo, killing over 100,000 and leaving over 1 million civilians homeless. <a id="link9-3" href="javascript:;">[9]</a> Meanwhile, plans for the invasion of Japan by the Allies and the defense of Japan by the Japanese continued to be drawn up. Estimates of casualties ranged in the millions, based on the number of casualties sustained in island battles such as Iwo Jima. However, these plans were never to come to fruition. On August 6, 1945, the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and six days later on Nagasaki. Six days after that, the Emperor of Japan made a radio broadcast announcing the unconditional surrender of Japan. The most destructive war in human history was finally over.</p><paper-tooltip for="link9-2" animationdelay="0" fittovisiblebounds="true" position="top">9.
